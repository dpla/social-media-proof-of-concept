# How to capture a Tiktok post using Browsertrix crawler

There are many different tools available that create web archives, but currently, the Browsertrix suite has the most affordances for capturing social media posts. Chiefly among these:

1. A suite of custom scripts to aid compatability with social media sites and facilitate captures called Browsertrix Behaviors. In the case of TikTok, Browsertrix Behaviors knows how to automatically expand comment threads and load additional comments beyond what shows in the browser when a video loads.

2. A facility for logging in an automated browser so that CAPCHAs can be prevented.

3. A browser plugin that allows someone to create a web archive without any expertise in running web archiving software.

Worth noting is the Scoop project from the Havard Library Innovation Lab, which previously was deployed in an experimental capacity for archiving Twitter/X posts. However, the current primary use case for this software does not require facilitating site logins, and without that, it can be difficult to evade CAPTCHAs on tiktok.com.
